# 2d_maze_simulation

This demonstrates a 2D environment which simulates eye movement through a path in a maze.

The purpose of this is to learn about serialization in Unity, creating a follow script which simulates eye movement, and serve as additional support should we face issues with the eye tracking.

Currently, there is a maze, and the followMouse script which allows the game object to follow the mouse cursor in game.

The next steps are to implement the serialization or database (which ever comes easiest) to export the mouse data. 

This same logic will be implemented in the cse120-unity-project repository with the eyetracking using the HTC Vive Eye Pro.
